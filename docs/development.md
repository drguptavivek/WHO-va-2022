# Developer guide

This guide covers local development of `@drguptavivek/who-2022-va`. For application integration, start with the [README](../README.md). For exported interfaces and functions, see the [API reference](api.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js compatible with the versions supported by the current dependencies
- pnpm 11.9.0 (the version pinned in `package.json`)
- Chromium installed through Playwright for browser end-to-end tests

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

The package is ESM-only. React is required by the UI entry points; React DOM, React Native, and React Native Web are optional peer dependencies so consumers install only the platforms they use.

## Run the project

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts the Vite demo at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. The demo uses the same web entry point published by the package.

Useful commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Check TypeScript without emitting files |
| `pnpm test` | Run Vitest unit, integration, tracer, and source-conformance tests |
| `pnpm test:watch` | Run Vitest in watch mode |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Run Playwright against the Vite demo |
| `pnpm test:e2e:headed` | Run the browser suite visibly and sequentially |
| `pnpm test:e2e:report` | Open the latest Playwright HTML report |
| `pnpm build` | Build ESM bundles, declarations, and source maps into `dist/` |
| `pnpm build:demo` | Produce a static demo build |
| `pnpm check` | Run type checking, Vitest, and the package build |

`pnpm check` intentionally does not include Playwright. Run `pnpm test:e2e` separately when a change affects controls, navigation, browser persistence, or form behavior.

## Source-of-truth rules

`src/generated/who-va-2022.instrument.json` is the authoritative executable instrument. It is checked in so builds are deterministic and offline. The runtime and package build must not read the workbook or import `exceljs`.

The workbook is a provenance artifact. `src/compiler/xlsform.ts` may read it only in tests to compare the source with the canonical JSON. The compiler must not regenerate or overwrite the checked-in contract.

When changing the instrument:

1. Edit the canonical JSON deliberately and review the diff as data.
2. Keep stable question names and coded choice values unless the external data contract is intentionally changing.
3. Update `who-va-2022.question-audit.json` when the human-review matrix must change with the contract.
4. Run source-conformance tests and the question-by-question test suite.
5. Document any intentional divergence from the retained workbook.

## Runtime flow

The headless engine is shared by every renderer:

```text
canonical instrument -> session -> calculations/relevance -> field validation
                                      -> navigation -> submission validation
```

`createWhoVaSession()` is the stateful boundary. It owns answers, the current visible section, navigation, and subscriptions. The validation functions are also exported independently for server-side or batch use. Renderers add controls and platform adapters but do not implement separate questionnaire rules.

The root entry point exposes a synchronous `whoVa2022Instrument` for compatibility. UI entry points call `loadWhoVa2022Instrument()` so the large JSON contract is parsed only when the first default form needs it.

## Making changes

### Engine or instrument behavior

Add focused tests under `tests/`. Prefer testing public functions or a session over duplicating internal calculations. If behavior originates in the workbook, include or update a source-conformance assertion.

### Shared controls

Controls belong in `src/ui/question-controls.tsx` and should use injected primitives and platform services. Keep questionnaire behavior outside platform-specific entry points. Verify shared behavior with Vitest and browser interaction with Playwright when relevant.

### Platform adapters

Keep native-only APIs in `src/native.tsx` or native adapter modules, and browser-only APIs in `src/web.tsx` or web adapter modules. Do not pull browser globals into the root entry point or native dependencies into the web bundle.

### Languages

Language files translate interviewer-facing text only. Question names, choice values, expressions, and stored answers remain unchanged. The public package ships only English; experimental translation fixtures in the repository must not be imported into a published entry point. See the README for the language-file shape, rights warning, and lazy-loader example.

### Attachments

Attachment handling is fail-closed. New formats or processing paths need byte-level validation, a canonical stored representation, lifecycle cleanup, and tests. Review [Attachment processing](attachments.md) before changing this boundary.

## Test strategy

The suites are intentionally layered:

- Unit tests cover dates, expressions, localization, attachments, and isolated controls.
- Tracer and integration tests cover calculations, constraints, sessions, web-component events, and runtime boundaries.
- Parameterized tests exercise every named WHO question through field and submission validation.
- Source-conformance tests compare the canonical JSON with the workbook without mutating either artifact.
- Playwright drives the rendered form, including error correction, age calculations, and navigation.

For a normal code change, run the narrowest related Vitest file while iterating, then `pnpm check`. Add `pnpm test:e2e` for user-visible browser or navigation changes.

## Build and package boundaries

`tsup.config.ts` emits four ESM entry points: root, native, web, and web component. React platform packages are externalized. Before publishing or consuming a local build, inspect `dist/` and confirm that:

- declarations exist for every entry point;
- the root bundle has no React, browser, React Native, Excel, or workbook dependency;
- platform-specific code remains behind its documented subpath;
- the generated instrument chunk needed at runtime is included;
- experimental translation fixtures are not included.

## Data and deployment responsibilities

This repository provides the instrument, offline interview state, validation, and client-side attachment canonicalization. A host application remains responsible for identity, encryption, access control, synchronization, retention, backups, device-loss handling, upload authorization, malware scanning, and authoritative server-side file validation.
