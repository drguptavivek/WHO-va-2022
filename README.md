# 2022 WHO Verbal Autopsy Instrument for JavaScript

An independent, React Native-first implementation of the **2022 WHO Verbal Autopsy instrument V1.1**. One checked-in, platform-neutral JSON contract drives Expo, React Native, React Native Web, non-React websites, field validation, and submission validation.

This project is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO). “WHO” identifies the source instrument only. See [Licensing and attribution](#licensing-and-attribution).

The runtime, package build, and test suite do **not** parse Excel or generate from XLSForm. The WHO workbook is retained only as a human-readable provenance/reference document; the checked-in JSON is the sole executable contract.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @drguptavivek/who-2022-va
```

The headless entry point has no UI peer requirement. Install the peers for the UI entry point you use:

```bash
# React web or the web component
npm install react react-dom react-native-web

# Expo / React Native (normally already supplied by the host application)
npm install react react-native
```

## Runtime performance

The canonical JSON remains one offline artifact, but the `/native` and `/web` form entry points no longer parse it when the application bundle starts. They dynamically load and cache it when a form first needs the default instrument. The root `@drguptavivek/who-2022-va` entry keeps the synchronous `whoVa2022Instrument` export for headless and server compatibility; applications concerned about startup cost can import `loadWhoVa2022Instrument` instead.

Opening the first default form still parses the complete instrument once. The runtime does not fetch a section at a time: relevance, calculations, navigation, and final validation can refer to questions in other sections, and the instrument must continue working completely offline. This trades a single predictable parse for simpler, reliable interviews; only the current section's controls are rendered. Further section chunking should be considered only if profiling the target low-spec devices shows this deferred parse is still material.

Once an instrument is used, the runtime validates and freezes it, verifies any supplied expression AST against its source, and builds shared indexes for questions by name, questions by section, sections by name, and calculated questions. Invalid custom instruments fail at this boundary rather than producing partial runtime behavior.

Indexes and source-derived expression ASTs are cached by object identity in `WeakMap`s. Sessions and translated instruments can be released normally, while repeated lookups avoid scanning all 450 questions or reparsing expressions.

Calculations run once after an answer changes and once for full submission validation. Relevance checks reuse that calculated state instead of recalculating the 38 derived fields for every question.

Session snapshots compute the visible section list once and render only its current questions. Answer-preview filtering is memoized and runs only while the preview is open.

Field validation remains real time. Type, choice, and constraint errors appear as the interviewer enters an answer and clear immediately after correction; Next and Complete still perform section or full-form validation.

Host-provided language modules are loaded on demand. Translation application structurally shares every unchanged section, question, and choice with the English instrument. JavaScript runtimes normally retain imported language modules in their module cache; applications can bound the loader's translated-instrument cache independently.

## Expo / React Native

```tsx
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native";
import {
  WhoVaForm,
  createWhoVaInitialDataFromPrefill,
  type WhoVaDraftStore
} from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va/native";

const draftStore: WhoVaDraftStore = {
  async save(draft) {
    // Use Expo SQLite, AsyncStorage, MMKV, or the app database here.
    await appStorage.set(`who-va-2022:draft:${draft.id}`, JSON.stringify(draft));
  }
};

export default function App() {
  const initialData = createWhoVaInitialDataFromPrefill({
    presets: {
      hivAidsMortality: selectedDeath.hivAidsMortality,
      malariaMortality: selectedDeath.malariaMortality
    },
    interviewer: { name: currentUser.name, id: currentUser.staffId, sex: currentUser.sex, language: "en" },
    deceased: {
      givenNames: selectedDeath.givenNames,
      surname: selectedDeath.surname,
      sex: selectedDeath.sex,
      citizenship: selectedDeath.citizenship,
      dateOfBirth: selectedDeath.dateOfBirth,
      dateOfDeath: selectedDeath.dateOfDeath
    },
    location: {
      state: selectedDeath.state,
      district: selectedDeath.district
    }
  });

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <WhoVaForm
        draftId={selectedDeath.id}
        initialData={initialData}
        draftStore={draftStore}
        platform={{
          pickDate: async (_question, _data, currentValue) => {
            // Open the host app's native date picker and return YYYY-MM-DD.
            return openNativeDatePicker(currentValue);
          },
          captureAudio: async () => {
            // Connect Expo Audio or the host application's recorder here.
            return { uri: "file:///recordings/va.m4a", mimeType: "audio/mp4" };
          },
          captureImage: async () => openCamera(),
          selectImage: async () => openImageLibrary(),
          selectFile: async (_question, _data, acceptedMimeTypes) => {
            // Connect Expo DocumentPicker and restrict it to acceptedMimeTypes.
            return openDocumentPicker(acceptedMimeTypes);
          }
        }}
        onDraftSaved={(draft) => console.log(`Saved ${draft.id}`)}
        onComplete={(result) => {
          if (result.valid) queueForSubmission(result.data);
        }}
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

`initialData` accepts canonical WHO question IDs directly, and `createWhoVaInitialDataFromPrefill()` maps common host context such as a death-list record, citizenship/nationality, logged-in interviewer profile, HIV/malaria mortality presets, and state/district location. Prefilled answers remain normal editable form answers unless the WHO instrument marks that question read-only. Keep host-only identifiers, such as a local death-list UUID or RBAC assignment ID, outside the WHO answer payload; pass them as `draftId` or attach them in your server submission envelope.

Prefill evidence is mutually exclusive: choose date of birth or reported age, and choose date of death or reported year. Caller-owned form sessions must be paired with their instrument and cannot also receive `initialData`; managed forms accept `initialData` and create their own session.

Language dropdown options display the English language name plus the local/native name. For custom language choices, use the ISO/BCP-47 tag as the choice value and provide `label.en` plus a native label keyed by the same tag or its base language, for example `{ value: "hi-IN", label: { en: "Hindi (India)", "hi-IN": "हिन्दी" } }`.

Date picking, audio capture, and draft storage are injected by the host so the module does not force a particular Expo SDK, database, upload service, or file lifecycle. The Save draft button and every Next/Complete press write a UUID-addressed envelope through `draftStore`. If `pickDate` is omitted on native, full-date questions remain usable as validated text inputs with alphabetic, localized months; order follows the locale (`DD-MMM-YYYY`, `MMM-DD-YYYY`, or `YYYY-MMM-DD`). On Android, pass `platform.pickDate` backed by `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` to open the calendar for full-date fields such as `Id10021`, `Id10023_a`, and `Id10023_b`; the Expo demo includes this adapter. Stored answers always use canonical `YYYY-MM-DD`. Web renderers use the browser's locale-aware native calendar control automatically. Date fields with the WHO `year` appearance, such as `Id10024`, use a four-digit year input rather than the full-date control.

## Reusable question controls

Both `/web` and `/native` export `WhoVaQuestionControls`. Its named components are `Text`, `Integer`, `Date`, `SingleChoice`, `MultipleChoice`, `Confirm`, `Audio`, `Image`, `File`, `Note`, `Calculated`, and `System`; `Control` dispatches from a question's canonical `control` value. These components accept the same question/value/data/issues/onAnswer contract and can be used outside the full form.

WHO text questions with `appearance: "multiline"`, including the detailed open narrative, use a tall multiline input. Image controls support camera/library selection, preview, hide/view, 90-degree rotation, zoom, replace, and remove. File controls request PDF MIME type only and support replace/remove. Web supplies browser selectors; Expo/React Native hosts connect camera, image-library, and document-picker functions through `platform`.

Attachment answers are durable references, not embedded base64 data. Browser images have their signature and dimensions checked from a bounded header before browser decoding, are resized and JPEG-encoded, and can be stored through an injected platform adapter; the answer JSON stores only an ID and metadata. Native adapters can provide `inspect(uri)` so the original camera file is decoded by the platform without first copying all of its bytes into the JavaScript heap. The processed native file remains a URI that the host can stream to its upload service.

The default limits protect low-memory devices: images are capped at 10 MB and 16 megapixels before processing, then reduced to at most 2048 pixels on the longest edge and 2 MB. PDFs are capped at 5 MB and 10 pages; the original PDF is replaced by JPEG page images no larger than 1600 pixels on the longest edge. Host applications may choose stricter image limits.

## React web

```tsx
import { WhoVaForm } from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va/web";

export function VerbalAutopsyPage() {
  return (
    <WhoVaForm
      draftStore={secureDraftStore}
      platform={secureAttachmentAndRecordingServices}
      onDraftSaved={(draft) => console.log(draft.id)}
      onComplete={(result) => submit(result.data)}
    />
  );
}
```

Web forms do not persist answers or enable binary capture by default. Pass a protected `draftStore` and host-controlled `platform` services; pass `draftId` to continue overwriting a known draft. Browser history stores only the active draft ID and navigation metadata, rejects state from another configured draft, and reload restoration reads answers only from the configured draft store. Audio questions use the browser microphone when recording services are supplied. Browser recordings are collected in one-second chunks so the 25 MB byte ceiling is enforced during recording, and they stop automatically after 30 minutes.

Upload a stored browser attachment as a `Blob`; do not convert it to base64:

```ts
import { loadWhoVaWebAttachmentBlob } from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va/web";

const blob = await loadWhoVaWebAttachmentBlob(attachmentReference);
if (blob) {
  const body = new FormData();
  body.append("file", blob, attachmentReference.name);
  await fetch("/api/attachments", { method: "POST", body });
}
```

After loading all drafts that must remain on the device, orphaned IndexedDB binaries can be removed explicitly:

```ts
import { cleanupWhoVaWebAttachments } from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va/web";

await cleanupWhoVaWebAttachments(allRetainedDrafts.map((draft) => draft.data));
```

Only call cleanup with the complete set of retained drafts/answers; omitted references are treated as deleted. Object URLs used for previews are revoked when controls release them.

`localStorage` and IndexedDB are unencrypted browser storage. For production VA data, provide secured adapters with the application's encryption, access-control, retention, and device-loss protections. Demos and low-risk prototypes can opt in explicitly with the deliberately named `createInsecureWhoVaBrowserDefaults()` helper:

```tsx
import { createInsecureWhoVaBrowserDefaults, WhoVaForm } from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va/web";

const insecurePrototypeDefaults = createInsecureWhoVaBrowserDefaults();
<WhoVaForm {...insecurePrototypeDefaults} />;
```

## Any web application

```ts
import {
  createWhoVaInitialDataFromPrefill,
  defineWhoVaElement
} from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va/web-component";

defineWhoVaElement();
```

```html
<div id="who-va-form-container"></div>

<script type="module">
  const form = document.createElement("who-va-2022-form");
  form.setAttribute("locale", "en");
  // Configure production storage before the element is connected.
  form.draftStore = secureDraftStore;
  form.platform = secureAttachmentAndRecordingServices;
  form.setAttribute("draft-id", selectedDeath.id);
  form.setData(
    createWhoVaInitialDataFromPrefill({
      interviewer: loggedInInterviewer,
      deceased: selectedDeath
    })
  );
  form.addEventListener("who-va-draft-saved", (event) => console.log(event.detail.id));
  form.addEventListener("who-va-complete", (event) => submit(event.detail.data));
  document.querySelector("#who-va-form-container").append(form);
  const assessment = form.validate();
</script>
```

The element exposes `draftStore` and `platform` properties plus `getData()`, `setData(data)`, `getDraftId()`, `validate()`, and `complete()`. Set secure draft and attachment services plus any `draft-id` attribute before attaching the element. Without those services the form still works in memory, Save draft and binary controls remain disabled, and the element generates a new UUID.

## Adding languages

The package ships only the unmodified English source instrument as a built-in language. `WHO_VA_2022_LANGUAGES` therefore contains only `en`. Host applications can use the localization APIs with translations for which they have the necessary rights or permissions.

The preferred runtime layout is one independent file per language. Each file is JSON-serializable and owns that locale's section labels, question text, hints, guidance, choice labels, constraint messages, and optional form UI strings:

```ts
// languages/fr.ts (languages/fr.json has the same data shape)
import type { WhoVaLanguageFile } from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va";

export default {
  locale: "fr",
  instrument: {
    sections: { va_interviewer: "Enquêteur AV" },
    questions: {
      Id10021: {
        label: "Quand la personne décédée est-elle née ?",
        hint: "Utilisez la meilleure date disponible",
        constraintMessage: "Saisissez une date de naissance valide",
        choices: { "1": "Oui", "0": "Non" }
      }
    }
  },
  ui: {
    next: "Suivant",
    required: "{label} est obligatoire"
  }
} satisfies WhoVaLanguageFile;
```

Register dynamic imports once. No language file is downloaded until it is selected; loaded files are cached. A regional request such as `fr-CA` falls back to the `fr` file, then to the base English instrument.

```tsx
import { createWhoVaLanguageLoader, whoVa2022Instrument } from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va";
import { WhoVaForm } from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va/web";

const loadLanguage = createWhoVaLanguageLoader(whoVa2022Instrument, {
  fr: () => import("./languages/fr.js"),
  sw: () => import("./languages/sw.js")
});

const language = await loadLanguage(selectedLocale);

<WhoVaForm
  instrument={language.instrument}
  locale={language.locale}
  uiTranslations={language.uiTranslations}
/>;
```

Stable question names and choice values are never translated, so saved submissions and branching logic remain compatible across languages. Constraint expressions are also shared; each language file supplies only the interviewer-facing `constraintMessage`.

Changing the loaded `instrument` and `locale` props switches the active language without discarding the current session answers.

### Adding translations manually

XLSForm is not required. A translation may be partial, so another question, hint, choice, or constraint message can be added whenever it becomes available:

```ts
import { whoVa2022Instrument, withInstrumentTranslation } from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va";

const instrument = withInstrumentTranslation(whoVa2022Instrument, "fr", {
  questions: {
    Id10021: {
      label: "Quand la personne décédée est-elle née ?",
      hint: "Utilisez la meilleure date disponible"
    },
    Id10022: {
      choices: {
        "1": "Oui",
        "0": "Non"
      },
      constraintMessage: "Sélectionnez une réponse valide"
    }
  }
});
```

Only the supplied fields are added. Existing translations are preserved, untranslated fields fall back to English, and question IDs, choice values, calculations, relevance rules, and stored answers are unchanged. The same `instrument` object can be passed directly to `WhoVaForm`, or the translation object can be placed under `instrument` in a lazy `WhoVaLanguageFile` as shown above.

Translations of the source questionnaire may be adaptations under its CC BY-ND 3.0 IGO licence. Confirm that you have the necessary permission before distributing a translated instrument.

## Web theming

The React web renderer and web component expose namespaced CSS custom properties. Set them on `:root`, an application wrapper, or one form instance; no component fork or `!important` override is needed.

```css
.my-va-page {
  --who-2022-web-color-brand: #275dad;
  --who-2022-web-color-brand-deep: #173b70;
  --who-2022-web-color-brand-soft: #eaf1fb;
  --who-2022-web-color-canvas: #f5f7fb;
  --who-2022-web-color-surface: #ffffff;

```

All web theme properties use the `--who-2022-web-` namespace. Less commonly needed tokens cover guidance, danger, and image-preview colors: `color-ink-subtle`, `color-guidance`, `color-danger`, `color-danger-border`, `color-danger-strong`, `color-danger-soft`, and `color-image-background`.

The form is mobile-first: it fills the available width with responsive padding, then stops growing at `--who-2022-web-form-max-width` (default `48rem`). The same cap applies in portrait and landscape, preventing long question text and controls from stretching across widescreen displays. Set the token on a wrapper or individual form when a host application needs a narrower measure. `--who-2022-web-form-padding` controls both gutters with one CSS length; `--who-2022-web-form-padding-inline` and `--who-2022-web-form-padding-block` can override the horizontal and vertical gutters independently.

## Headless validation

```ts
import { validateSubmission, whoVa2022Instrument } from "@drguptavivek/who-2022-va";

const assessment = validateSubmission(whoVa2022Instrument, incomingPayload);
if (!assessment.valid) {
  return { status: 422, issues: assessment.issues };
}

await save(assessment.data);
```

This is the same validator used by native and web sessions. Interactive sessions also run field validation after each accepted answer, so users see constraint errors before pressing Next.

When Next or Complete finds validation issues, the shared renderer aligns the first invalid question at the top of the screen and highlights its error card. Web also focuses the first interactive control; Expo and React Native use the question's measured content position with `ScrollView.scrollTo`.

## Development and tests

```bash
pnpm dev          # launch the browser preview at http://127.0.0.1:5173
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test         # includes source-conformance and runtime tests
pnpm test:e2e     # run Chromium form automation with trace, video, and HTML report
pnpm test:e2e:headed # watch each action at 800 ms and each form sequentially
pnpm test:e2e:report # open the most recent Playwright report
pnpm build
pnpm check
pnpm check:all    # full package gate plus Chromium end-to-end tests
```

Install the pinned Playwright browser once with `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`. The browser suite enters answers through the rendered controls, captures validation errors and corrected states, verifies the visible age summary and calculated values derived from `Id10021`, and confirms valid paths can advance without alerts. GitHub Actions runs both `pnpm check` and the Chromium suite.

Canonical artifacts:

- `src/generated/who-va-2022.instrument.json` — authoritative runtime instrument
- `src/generated/who-va-2022.question-audit.json` — human-reviewable question matrix retained alongside the contract

The package build reads only the checked-in JSON. Tests may compile the retained XLSForm in memory to detect source drift and verify type, coded values, requiredness, relevance AST, constraints, calculations, field validation, and isolated submission validation. The test compiler never regenerates or modifies the JSON.

### Deviations from WHO form / gotchas

The canonical JSON intentionally keeps a few runtime adaptations separate from the retained XLSForm:

- `nmh` is shown under `consented > injuries_accidents` so the mid-form guidance appears with the injury section instead of as a detached completion-screen item.
- `Id10365` omits the source constraint because the upstream rule rejects a valid normal-birth-weight combination.
- `Id10382` uses `(.>=0 and .<=98) or .=99` instead of `.>=0 and .<=99`, matching the interviewer guidance that `99` means do not know and actual `88` hours should be entered as `87`.
- `Id10023_a`, `Id10023_b`, and `Id10382` use clearer app-supplied English constraint messages.
- Four source constraints are retained and evaluable but inert for valid app inputs: `Id10260`, `Id10414`, `Id10414_a`, and `Id10414_b`. Their constraint formulas mention values that are not in the compiled app choice lists for those questions, so normal runtime validation cannot raise a constraint error from them.
